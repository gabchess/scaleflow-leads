# /onboard - point this pipeline at YOUR customers

This repo shipped one run for one ICP. Yours is different. Three steps make it yours,
about 15 minutes.

## Step 1 - your ICP goes in the gates (5 min)

Open `src/icp.ts`. Everything the pipeline accepts or rejects lives in the zod schemas:

- `CompanyTypeSchema` - the company categories you sell to
- `CountrySchema` - your geographies
- `CompanySchema` headcount `.min()` / `.max()` - your size band
- `DecisionMakerTitleSchema` - who counts as a buyer for you

Edit the enum values and bounds. Then run `pnpm test`: the suite parses every gate, so
a typo fails loudly here instead of silently at 2am mid-scrape.

The gates DISQUALIFY, they never score. Dead site, generic info@ inbox, nobody who owns
sales: a row that trips one is out, and the row says which gate killed it. Keep that
property when you add gates. A binary gate can be debugged; a weighted score cannot.

## Step 2 - your keys (5 min)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

- `APIFY_TOKEN` - powers the LinkedIn signal pass. The shipped run cost $4.12.

Two integrations have no key to paste:

- **Crunchbase** needs a logged-in browser state, not an API key. Log into a trial
  account once, save the session as `.crunchbase.storageState.json` (see the scraper
  header comment). Skipping Crunchbase is fine: Clutch produced 71 of the 100 rows.
- **Clay** runs through its own MCP server, configured in your Claude/host settings,
  not in this repo. Without it you still get scraped + filtered companies; you lose
  the contact-enrichment columns.

## Step 3 - run in order (5 min to first output)

```bash
pnpm install && npx playwright install chromium
pnpm test              # 42 tests green before you trust anything
pnpm scrape:clutch
pnpm scrape:crunchbase # optional, needs the storage state
pnpm normalize         # merge, dedupe, gate -> data/companies.csv
pnpm agent             # scores each company, stops at YOUR approval
```

`pnpm mcp` exposes the whole pipeline as an MCP server so an agent can drive it.

## What this skill never does

Send email, buy data, bypass a login wall, or mark a lead qualified without a human
approving it. The human gate in `src/agent/qualify.ts` is the product, not a demo step.

**Next step:** edit `src/icp.ts`, run `pnpm test`, and scrape.
